The idea of this document is to provide a guide for teams adopting a SOA based on Microservices. It is divided in 5 aspects: **Provisioning**, **Delivery**, **Tests**, **Resilience** and **Domain Modularity**, each one containing gradual stages.

The goal for this Maturity Model is to provide guidance to teams that are already using microservices on what could be **the next improvement**. Every aspect contains incremental improvements, meaning that the team should look for improvements regarding stages 1 and 2 before start working on stage 3.

Feel free to **contribute** with comments and suggestions on what you feel is important, this stuff is not battle-proven yet but we want to have the best information we possibly can. If you feel like the order of stages is wrong, a topic should be expanded or something new should be included, just let me know! **Every feedback counts** :\)
