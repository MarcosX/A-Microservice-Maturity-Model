# Resilience

1. **Logs & alerts**: Logs and alerts from hosts/services are captured in a common place and are used to notify the team about issues with the application

2. **Automated health checks**: Every service emits health checks so the team can easily detect failures and act on them

3. **Elastic environments**: New services can be added as the application needs without changes in already deployed instances

4. **Degrading functionality**: Services not only emit health checks but act on them to contain downstream problems \(Circuit Breakers\) and degrade functionality instead of completely breaking the application

5.
