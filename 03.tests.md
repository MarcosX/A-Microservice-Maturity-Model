1. **Isolated testing**: Each service is tested on its own, with unit tests using doubles or component tests using doubles or in-memory storage

2. **Integrated testing**: Services are tested considering the communication paths and interaction between components, including their contracts

3. **Consumer-driven Contract testing**: Services are continuously tested against the contract provided by their consumers, ensuring they work as expected by external clients

4. **Cross functional testing**: Traits like response time, availability, load, security are tested across all services ensuring the cross functional requirements are met

5. **Production monitoring through tests**: Tests are continuously made in production to find bottlenecks and fix issues before customer even sees them, making the system antifragile.
