1. **Distributed Monolith:Code may be distributed in different services but they are anemic and share a great amount of resources**

2. **Independent releases: Services can be deployed to an environment without affecting already deployed services or without depending on specific versions of other services to be deployed together**

3. **Good citizen services:Standards regarding Service Level Agreement \(SLA\), Non-functional requirements, logging, health checks etc. are well known and used across all services \(with exceptions when necessary\)**

4. **Well rounded services:Every service owns everything it needs with a clear separation of business boundaries**

5. **Replaceable services:A service can be replaced without major changes to the architecture, as long as the business boundaries remain the same and good citizenship standards are followed**
