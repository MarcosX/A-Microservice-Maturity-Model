1. **Copy-and-paste: new hosts are provisioned by manually installing dependencies and copying configuration from existing services**

2. **Service pipelines: services can be deployed to hosts using an automated pipeline that can be triggered on every check-in**

3. **Shared binaries: the same binary is used when deploying to all environments and configured as needed**

4. **Automatic provisioning: hosts configurations and dependencies are automated and the code is under source control**

5. **Phoenix servers: new hosts are destroyed and recreated as needed**
