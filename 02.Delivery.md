1. **Continuous Integration**: Every service has their own Continuous Integration pipeline which deploys and tests them in dev/testing environments on every check-in

2. **Automated Deploys**: Deploying a service is a completely automated task that require minimal manual interaction

3. **Independent Deploys**: Every service can be deployed independently, providing backwards compatibility

4. **Continuous Delivery**: Services are always in a releasable state and releasing a feature is solely a business decision that can be done without extra effort from the team

5. **Phased deployment**: When releasing a new feature, the deployment can be rolled back/forward as needed with minor impact to customers
